# What are Controllers in Spring?

### Definition

In Spring, a **Controller** is a class that handles HTTP requests and sends responses to the client. Controllers act as the middle layer between the frontend (or any client making HTTP requests) and the backend (typically the service and database layers). They are a core part of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, which is used to structure web applications.

In a RESTful web service, controllers are responsible for processing incoming REST API requests, executing business logic (often by calling service classes), and returning responses in the form of JSON or XML data.

### Key Responsibilities of a Controller:

1. **Handling HTTP Requests**:
   - Controllers handle different types of HTTP requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
   - Based on the HTTP request, the controller will invoke the appropriate method.

2. **Mapping URLs to Methods**:
   - Controllers use annotations like `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., to map specific URLs (or endpoint paths) to Java methods.
   - For example, `/api/users` could be mapped to a method that handles user-related operations.

3. **Processing Input Data**:
   - Controllers can receive data from the client via request parameters, request body, path variables, or query parameters.
   - This input data is usually processed or passed on to the service layer for further logic.

4. **Returning Responses**:
   - Controllers return responses to the client, usually in the form of JSON, XML, or HTTP status codes.
   - In Spring, this is achieved by returning objects or primitive data types, which are automatically serialized to the appropriate format by Spring's built-in converters.

### Example of a Basic Controller:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    // Handles GET requests to /api/users
    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        // Logic to return all users
        return userService.findAll();
    }

    // Handles GET requests to /api/users/{id}
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to return a specific user by ID
        return userService.findById(id);
    }

    // Handles POST requests to /api/users
    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Logic to create a new user
        return userService.save(user);
    }

    // Handles PUT requests to /api/users/{id}
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
        // Logic to update an existing user
        return userService.update(id, user);
    }

    // Handles DELETE requests to /api/users/{id}
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to delete a user by ID
        userService.delete(id);
    }
}
```

### **Rest Controller**

#### Definition
`@RestController` is a specialized version of the `@Controller` annotation in Spring, used to build RESTful web services. It combines the functionality of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, simplifying the creation of REST APIs by automatically serializing objects to JSON or XML and sending them as HTTP responses.

#### Key Points:
- **Used for RESTful APIs**: The `@RestController` is specifically designed for APIs that return data (usually in JSON or XML format) instead of rendering web views (like HTML pages).
- **Automatic `@ResponseBody`**: Every method in a class annotated with `@RestController` will automatically have `@ResponseBody` behavior, meaning that the return value will be written directly to the HTTP response body instead of being interpreted as a view name.
- **Simplifies Development**: By using `@RestController`, you donâ€™t have to annotate each method with `@ResponseBody` individually.

#### Example

```
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;


@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}

```


### **@RequestMapping**

#### Definition:

`@RequestMapping` is an annotation used to map web requests (HTTP requests) to specific handler methods or classes in Spring MVC. It can be applied at both the **class level** and the **method level**.

- At the **class level**, `@RequestMapping` defines the base URL for all the methods inside the class.
- At the **method level**, `@RequestMapping` maps specific HTTP operations (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to specific handler methods.

#### Key Points:

- **Path Mapping**: Use `@RequestMapping` to map URLs to methods in your controllers. For example, you might map the `/api/users` URL to a method that handles user-related operations.
- **HTTP Methods**: You can specify the HTTP methods (like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for the request using the `method` attribute. Alternatively, you can use more specific annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
- **Flexible Parameters**: `@RequestMapping` allows you to specify path variables, query parameters, request headers, etc., and map them to method parameters.

#### Example (Class Level and Method Level `@RequestMapping`):

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    // Handles GET requests to /api/users
    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        // Logic to return all users
    }

    // Handles GET requests to /api/users/{id}
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to return a specific user by ID
    }

    // Handles POST requests to /api/users
    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Logic to create a new user
    }

    // Handles PUT requests to /api/users/{id}
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
        // Logic to update an existing user
    }

    // Handles DELETE requests to /api/users/{id}
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to delete a user by ID
    }
}
```
