# Incident Management System

The Incident Management System aims to streamline the tracking, assignment, and resolution of IT incidents within an organization. It provides a centralized platform for users to log incidents, assign tasks, monitor progress, and ensure timely issue resolution while maintaining security and audit trails.

## Overview


### Problem

 - Understand the purpose of the system: to manage IT incidents, track progress, assign tasks, and resolve issues.
 - Identify stakeholders (e.g., IT team, managers, end users) and gather their requirements.

### Functional Requirements

 - **Incident creation and tracking**: Users should be able to log new incidents, assign them priority levels, and track their status.
 - **Incident assignment**: Incidents must be assigned to specific team members or roles (like a system admin).
 - **Notifications and alerts**: Users should receive alerts for updates, assignments, or changes in incident status.
 - **Audit logs**: Track who created, updated, or closed an incident, and maintain a history of changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle increased incidents as the organization grows.
- **Security**: Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption for sensitive information.
- **Performance**: Ensure that the system responds quickly, especially for high-priority incidents.

## System Design

### Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- Use **Spring Boot** for the backend to handle business logic, database interactions, and security features.
- **RESTful APIs** will be developed to allow interaction with the frontend.

### Frontend (React.js)
- Use **React.js** for the frontend to manage user interaction and dynamic content rendering.
- **Axios** or **Fetch API** will be used to make HTTP requests to the backend.

### Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Use a **relational database** to manage incident data, including users, incidents, and audit logs.
- CRUD method
      - Create incidents (with POST requests).
      - Read incidents (with GET requests).
      - Update incidents (with PUT requests).
      - Delete
- Design tables for **Incidents**, **Users**, and **Audit Logs**.

## Development Steps

### 1. Set Up the Development Environment
- **Backend**: Create a Spring Boot project using **Spring Initializr** with dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Security, and JPA.
- **Frontend**: Set up the React.js project using **Create React App**.
- **Database**: Configure **MySQL** with the Spring Boot backend.

### 2. Backend Development
- Define **models**: Incident, User, Audit Log.
      - define the structure of the data
- Set up **repositories** using **Spring Data JPA**.
      - interfaces that provide CRUD operations and handle the interaction between your Java application and the database
- Create **controllers** to handle API requests for incidents, users, and logs.
      - Controllers are annotated with @RestController and typically use @RequestMapping to define the endpoint paths.
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based access control (RBAC)** using **Spring Security**.

### 3. Frontend Development
- Build components for **IncidentForm**, **IncidentList**, and **IncidentDetails**.
- Implement **state management** using **React Hooks** or **Redux**.
- Connect the frontend to the backend via **Axios** for REST API calls.
- Implement user authentication and conditionally render components based on the logged-in user's role.

### 4. Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Use **JUnit** for testing backend services and **React Testing Library** for frontend components.
- **Integration Testing**: Test API integration using tools like **Postman** or **Swagger**.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure that role-based access is functioning correctly and test for vulnerabilities.

### 5. Debugging and Performance Optimization
- Debug issues using Spring Boot logs and React Developer Tools.
- Optimize SQL queries for fast data retrieval.
- Monitor system performance using **Spring Boot Actuator**.

### 6. Deployment
- **Backend**: Deploy the Spring Boot application on **AWS EC2**, **Heroku**, or **Google Cloud**.
- **Frontend**: Deploy the React app on platforms like **Netlify** or **AWS S3**.
- Set up a **production database** on **AWS RDS** or another cloud provider.

### 7. Maintenance & Future Enhancements
- Regularly monitor and fix bugs as they arise.
- Implement additional features such as advanced filtering, reporting, or integration with third-party services like **email/SMS notifications**.

## Security Considerations
- **User Authentication**: Use **JWT tokens** to manage user sessions securely.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control ensures that users can only perform actions allowed by their roles.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in the database and use HTTPS for all communications.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Reporting**: Add analytics and reporting for incident trends, resolution times, and team performance.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Consider integrating email or SMS notifications to keep users informed about critical incidents.
- **Mobile Support**: Develop a mobile-friendly interface or mobile app for managing incidents on the go.
